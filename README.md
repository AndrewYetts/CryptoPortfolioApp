# CryptoPortfolioApp

CryptoPortfolioApp is an ASP.NET web application that allows users to sign in and keep record of their crypto currencies through CRUD operations. It utilizes CoinGecko API to get the updated prices of the current user's crypto currencies and a locally hosted Microsoft SQL Server to store those records. ASP.NET Core Identity is used to manage the user account functionality and Entity Framework as the object relational mapper.
